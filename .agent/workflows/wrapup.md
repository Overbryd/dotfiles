description: Wrap up the current implementation by running tests and other pre-commit tasks
---

In order to wrap up an implementation cycle, you need to perform the project specific pre commit action.

- Determine the best pre-commit action:

  - Check for `mix precommit`
  - Check for `Makefile`

- Run the pre-commit action
- Iterate on its errors until fixed
- Report in a Walkthrough
